%Instrument tuner core function - to be called to perform a voice test.
%code with elements from the original LiveRecorder by Markus Wallmer
%I re-wrote the user interface and the processing functions to do the task
%I want.
%
%Inputs:
%   whatInstrumentID- as user said in the front-end, the NUMERICAL ID of
%   the instrument to be tuned
%   targetDevice    - the ID of the sound input device to be recording from
%   fs              - sampling frequency [Hz]
%   nbits           - number of bits to define sound
%   freqQuality     - frequency resolution (quality) of the tuning process: raw (33 cents) / fine (10 cents) / ear-quality (5 cents)
%Outputs: 
    %funcOutput     - it's going to be a 1, saying the function ended successfully.
    %When the function execution stops (because the user said so), the frontEnd will close itself
%
%Updated v0.3 "Coffee and Donuts" 2018-11-30
%   CHANGELOG: Added an "ideal high-pass filter" at 20Hz to kill all
%   infrasound background noise
%Updated v0.2 Tuesday       - 2018-11-20
%   CHANGELOG: Matlab function format, to be called from the front-end script
%Updated v0.1 EdvardGrieg   - 2018-11-18
%   CHANGELOG: Managed to make the GUI plot the time and freq. domain plots% 
%              First version to complete a test!!!
